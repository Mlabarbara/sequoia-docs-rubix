# Infrastructure Overview

This section provides comprehensive documentation about our infrastructure, including hardware specifications, network architecture, and storage solutions.

## Core Components

Our infrastructure consists of three main components:

### Hardware
- Dell PowerEdge servers (R440 and R630) for primary compute resources
- Enterprise-grade network devices for reliable connectivity
- Specialized equipment for specific workloads

### Network Architecture
- Robust network topology design
- Enterprise-grade switches for high-performance connectivity
- Redundant configurations for high availability

### Storage Solutions
- Proxmox Backup Server for VM backups and disaster recovery
- TrueNAS for network-attached storage
- QNAP systems for additional storage needs

## Infrastructure Management

Our infrastructure is managed through several key systems:

1. **Proxmox Virtual Environment**: For virtualization and container management
2. **Active Directory**: For centralized authentication and resource management
3. **Network Management**: Including firewall configurations and VPN access
