# Network Architecture

This section provides an overview of our network infrastructure, including the physical topology, connectivity, and key components.

## Network Topology

Our network infrastructure consists of redundant ISP connections, enterprise switches, servers, and workstations distributed across offices.

## Key Components

### Network Connectivity
- **Dual ISP**: Redundant internet connections through Cisco Firepower (FPR) firewall
- **Enterprise Switch**: Core switch for network distribution with direct firewall connection to R440 for redundancy
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate VLANs for different network functions

### Compute Resources
- **R440 Server**: Primary virtualization host running VMs and LXC containers
- **R630 Server**: Secondary virtualization host for redundancy and load distribution

### Storage Infrastructure
- **Proxmox Backup Server**: Dedicated backup solution for virtual environments
- **TrueNAS Server**: Network-attached storage for file sharing and backups
- **QNAP NAS**: Additional storage solution for specific department needs

### End User Access
- **Workstations**: 25 workstations distributed across three office areas
- **Network Access**: Redundant paths to core infrastructure
- **Security**: Implemented at switch level with VLANs and access controls

## Network Design Principles

1. **Redundancy**: All critical systems have redundant connections
2. **High Availability**: Dual ISP and switch configuration ensures continuous operation
3. **Scalability**: Infrastructure designed to accommodate future growth
4. **Security**: Network segmentation and access controls at multiple levels

## Maintenance and Monitoring

- Regular network performance monitoring
- Scheduled maintenance windows for updates
- Backup verification and testing
- Network security audits
