# TP-Link T1600G-48PS Switch Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Power Over Ethernet (PoE) Problems

1. **Phones Not Receiving Power**
    - If is a sales phone, good chance it needs a power cable to work  
    --They are plugged into the Comcast router for "call dropping" issues--
    - Check if the connected device is PoE-compatible
    - Verify the PoE budget hasn't been exceeded (384W total)
    - Ensure the Ethernet cable is properly connected
    - Test with a different port

2. **Port Status Indicators**
    - Solid Green: Link established
    - Blinking Green: Active data transmission
    - Amber: PoE power being delivered
    - Off: No connection

### Network Connectivity Issues

1. **Link Problems**
    - Verify cable connections
    - Check port configuration (speed/duplex settings)
    - Inspect for port errors in switch interface

2. **VLAN Configuration**
    - Confirm VLAN assignments
    - Check trunk port settings
    - Verify PVID configuration

## Basic Troubleshooting Steps
